# 🧠 Smart Campus AI Decision Support & Automation System

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Campus AI Decision Support & Automation System** is an intelligent platform designed to simulate a real-world university service environment. It processes structured user requests and dynamically routes them through appropriate AI modules to generate accurate and efficient responses.

The system acts as a **centralized smart service desk** for students, instructors, and staff by integrating multiple AI techniques into a single unified workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a unified platform for handling campus service requests  
- Automate decision-making using AI techniques  
- Dynamically route requests based on their type  
- Improve efficiency in campus operations and services  

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. **User Request Submission** (structured input)  
2. **Preprocessing** (validation & cleaning)  
3. **Request Routing** (selects appropriate pipeline)  
4. **Module Execution** (AI-based processing)  
5. **Final Response Generation**  

---

## 🧩 Core Modules
- 🔍 **Search Module** – Handles route guidance and navigation  
- 🧠 **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** – Classifies request types  
- 📚 **Logic / Knowledge Base** – Handles eligibility & rule-based queries  
- 📐 **CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)** – Manages scheduling & resource allocation  
- ⚡ **Priority Handler** – Handles urgent requests  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Intelligent request routing  
- Multi-module AI integration  
- Real-time decision support
